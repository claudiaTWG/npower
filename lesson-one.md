# Session One - Introduction to Programming

## Introductions/Housekeeping

## Session Goal
To help you get more comfortable talking, collaborating, and participating in conversations and practices around programming. We'll be doing a bit of group programming in order to develop this mindset.

## Step One: Get into Groups!

Please organize yourself into the group that best characterizes your experience with programming.

### Group A: I have little to no experience programming, or I have only done a little HTML & CSS.

### Group B: I have done a little bit of programming outside of HTML & CSS, but I would love a refresher or don't write that kind of code too frequently.

### Group C: I am familiar with one or more programming languages beyond HTML & CSS, and write code frequently.

## Step Two: Warmup Exercise

### What is programming?
A set of instructions meant for a computer to execute. Computers are very fast, but they take everything very literally.

Imagine that a space alien from another planet came down to our classroom today, and we wanted to know where the parking garage was so they can could park their spaceship without getting a ticket. How would we be able to give them directions in a way that they would understand?

Tell them it's "down the elevators"? What if they don't know what an "elevator" is?

We'll have to be more specific. Think about breaking down all the little steps that are involved in getting to the kitchen.

Turn around. Take five steps. Press the button that has a little down arrow on it.
Wait for the sliding doors to open.
Walk through the sliding doors.
Push the button 'P' for parking.
etc.

In order to get warmed up and ready to tackle the upcoming excercises, we'll need to **think like a computer**.

In small groups, write out detailed step by step instructions for how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

## Step Three: Coding Challenges
Now that we're warmed up, let's start working through the coding challenges.

We'd like to you work on these challenges in groups. You can each work off your own laptop, but you should work through the solutions and each step together. No one should be working independentantly.

We'll assign a mentor to each group to help you work through these problems, as well as to facilitate group conversation.

### Some Pair Programming Tips
- Ask each other questions rather than leading with strong opinions
- Resist the urge to interrupt each other
- Don't go off and work on your own, work as a team.
- Take a break!
- Make sure to engage all the members of your team
- Take turns driving/navigating
- Celebrate achivements!
- Let the mentors help you


Group A, your challenges start <a href="https://repl.it/@swbloom/Beginner-JS-Part-One">here</a>.

Group B, your challenges start <a href="https://repl.it/@swbloom/Beginner-JS-Part-Two">here</a>.

Group C, start with these pre-problems <a href="https://github.com/twg/npower/blob/master/pre-problems.js">here</a>, and then move on to the advent of code challenges <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">here</a>.


- Divide groups into smaller groups
- Give each group link to GitHub repo
- Demonstrate how REPL.it works
- Have students work on coding challenges with mentors

## Group Sharing
- What did you enjoy about working in a group? What challenges?
- Describe a success you had, or something that you learned. Describe a hurdle you experienced.

## Next Steps
- Post your solutions online (GitHub is a great place to start)
- Write a blog post about your learnings (Medium is a great free platform for this)
